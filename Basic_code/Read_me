>>>>>>>>>>Amino_acid_composition
The amino acid composition is the number of amino acids of each type normalized with the total number of residues.
It is defined as Comp(i) = ni∗100/N, 
where i stands for the 20 amino acid residues; ni is the number of residues of each type, and N is the total number of residues. The summation is through all the
residues in the considered protein.
example of application- Amino acid composition is one of the parameters, which can be used to identify β-barrel membrane proteins.
