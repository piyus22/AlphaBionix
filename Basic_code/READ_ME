>>>>>>>>>>Amino_acid_composition
Input_file- Enter file containing protein sequences
OUtput- Creates a file with amiino acid composition 
The amino acid composition is the number of amino acids of each type normalized with the total number of residues.
It is defined as Comp(i) = ni∗100/N, 
where i stands for the 20 amino acid residues; ni is the number of residues of each type, and N is the total number of residues. The summation is through all the
residues in the considered protein.
example of application- Amino acid composition is one of the parameters, which can be used to identify β-barrel membrane proteins.

>>>>>>>>>>>Concensus.py
5 different Dna sequences with length of 5 residues are aligned on one over another and a consensus sequence is determined (for every residue position the maximum occuring residue is determined)
Application- example-to determine the ancestral dna sequence.


>>>>>>>>>>GC_content.py
GC content refers to the Guanine and cytosine content within a DNA sequence. To calculate this we find the count of both this residues and divide it by the length of the entire sequence.
Application- example-To decipher sequences which have diference in GC content to determine their possible role, an instance could be that they may be a part of the promoter region, apart from this there are lot of posibilities, Hence an important measure.


>>>>>>>>>>Machine_learning_basic_file
Input1- Training file.csv (composed of 19 features (values can be changed as per requirement))
Input2- Contains the labels (0,1) of the feature file

The code is used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, MCC, Likelihood, Positive predicted value (PPV) and Accuracy, using False positive (FP), True Positive (TP), False negative (FN), True negative (TN).


>>>>>>>>>GC_skew.py
Input- DNA sequence file
The code splits the entire sequence as per window size and then calculates the GC skew.
GC skew-GC skew is when the nucleotides guanine and cytosine are over- or under-abundant in a particular region of DNA or RNA.


>>>>>>>>>>motif_pos
Input1-Enter DNA sequence
Input2- Motif pattern to be found
Motif-a sequence motif is a nucleotide or amino-acid sequence pattern that is widespread and has been proven or assumed to have a biological significance.
This code finds the motif positon in the dna sequence.
